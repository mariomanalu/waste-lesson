# WasteWorld

## Inspiration
We are inspired by the theme of this hackathon, which is **sustainability**.  When we think about sustainability, we think about **waste**. When we think about waste, we think about **waste recycling**. We believe that everyone can recycle some of their waste. The problem is only a handful of people know where to start. Mario, personally, has always been interested in recycling, but he hardly knows what type of waste can be recycled and how it can be recycled. We believe that Mario is not the only person with this problem. So, we are inspired to teach people about waste recycling and management. We know that game is one of the most effective teaching medium. Thus, we created a game that teaches people what and how waste can be recycled.

## What it does
Waste Lesson is an RPG, 2D seeing top-down game in which a person can move and visit checkpoints in the form of planets to learn something about waste at different checkpoints.

## How we built it
Mario wrote a couple of JS scripts, and Babette worked on the research, design, and development of the webapp.

## Challenges we ran into
1. Time management. There is simply not enough time to make every feature work out well.
2. We have not coded for 5.5 months, so we had a rough start.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
1. We finished the barebone of the game!
2. We consider this web app a success if there is at least one person who now knows what waste goes where from using this webapp.

## What we learned
1. There is so much waste.
2. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to recycling and waste management.
3. We coded!
4. We designed in Figma!
